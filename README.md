<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](./assets/command-screen-01.png)
<!-- ![Product Name Screen Shot](./assets/command-screen-02.png) -->

I don't like switching contexts / active windows during coding. [Raycast]() itself, already is a great enhancement to my workflow, as it simplifies lots of micro-tasks during my day and enables me to do them fully via keyboard.  
As I like to hear new music while coding I created this small command, which enables me adding new tracks I like to a playlist, without needing to open the spotfiy app itself.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can start using the extension by cloning this repository and building it on your own. You can then install it locally via raycast. To do so, navigate to `Preferences -> Extension -> + -> Add Script Directory`.

### Prerequisites

This extension comes pre-configured using the ClientId of a spotify application I created. You can always create your own application through the spotify developer portal and replace my clientId within the `preferences` array in `package.json`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/eimerreis/raycast-spotify-add-to-playlist.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. (optional) Enter your own ClientId
   ```json
    // package.json

    {
        ...
        "preferences": [
            {
              "name": "spotifyClientId",
              ...
              "default": "INSERT-YOUR-CLIENTID-HERE"
            }
        ],
    }
   ```
